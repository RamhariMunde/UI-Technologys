Deffrence between React and Angular ?
->   React is a library, but Angular is a full-fledged framework.  
 - The virtual DOM and one-way data binding are used by React. js, 
 but the real DOM and two-way data binding are used by Angular. 
 There's also a speed difference (React's is faster) and a difference 
 in bundle size (React's is smaller) (React works a bit faster).     

A) Key Features of React ?

- React’s key features include the ability to use third-party libraries.
- Time-Saving
- Composability and Simplicity
- Facebook is fully behind you.
- Improved user experience and lightning-fast speed.
- More rapid development
- One-directional data binding provides code stability.
- Components in React

B) Key Features of Angular ?

- Built-in support for AJAX, HTTP, and Observables are just a few of Angular’s highlights. There is widespread support in the community.
- In line with current technologies
- Typescript is time-saving.
- Coding that is more clear and concise
- Error-handling support has been improved.
- Angular CLI allows for seamless updates.
- Validation and forms
- Local CSS / shadow DOM

Who is using React ?

# Single Page Application (SPA) And Multiple Page Application (MPA)
1) Single Page Application (SPA)
- A single-page Application is an app that works inside a browser and dose
 not require page reload during use.

- SPAs are all about serving an outstanding user experience (UX)
 by trying to imitate a 'natural' environment in the browser -- no page reloads, 
 no extra wait time. It is just one HTML page that you visit which then loads all
 other content using JavaScript.

 ex: Gmail, Facebook,Instagram, Trello.

2) Multiple Page Application (MPA)
- Multi-page Application works in a " traditional" way.
Every change like, display the data or submit data back to server, sends a request
to the server to render a new page in the browser.

whenever a user navigates from one page to another, a require is
sent to server to send a new HTML file for that URL.

the server returns a file and then HTML file is loaded in the browser.

Ex: Dribble, Harvald's official Site.

# Creating our First React Application 

### How to React Optimization Techniques ####

1. React Lazy and Suspense
-> my this is comes with Bydefault in React Application

import LazyComponent from './LazyComponent';
import { components } from 'chakra-react-sel

const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import)

2.Browser level lazy loading of images( General way )
-> it is use to adding images General
<img ="./yourimage" alt="image-description" loading="lazy"/>

3. React Memo ( only when required)
-> but do not use more memo only when you require. ( beacues to mach use is not good for Optimization)

const MyComponent = React.Memo(props => {
});

4. stop unecessary re-renders by profiling 
-> this is menualy 

   use React profiling ( dev tools )
