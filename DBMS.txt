DBMS :
- DBMS stands for Database Management System. It is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data stored in a database.
- The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a convenient, efficient, and safe way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
  It enables users to interact with the database in a variety of ways, such as querying data, modifying data, and creating reports.
- A DBMS provides a layer of abstraction between the users and the physical storage of the data, making it easier for users to access and work with the data. 
  The DBMS also ensures the integrity of the data by enforcing rules and constraints, and it provides security features to protect the data from unauthorized 
  access or modification.
- Some of the popular DBMSs include Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Each DBMS has its own features, advantages, 
  and disadvantages, and the choice of a DBMS depends on the specific requirements of the application or organization.
